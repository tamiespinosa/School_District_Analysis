## <a name="OverviewProject"></a>Overview of Project

A school distric wants an analysis of their standarized test outcomes for math and reading for various high schools. The data for all students in these high schools was analyzed to find trends in school performance using information such as school size and budget [[3]](#3)[[4]](#4). Aditionally, the data for the Thomas High School 9th grade has been brought into question due to inconsistancies. The analysis was performed with and without this data. The effects of this data removal will be further explained. 

### <a name="purpose"></a>Purpose

 The analysis will provide the following information for data excluding and including Thomas High School 9th grade [[1]](#1)[[2]](#2).
 
* A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics
* An overview of the key metrics for each school
* Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
  - Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  - The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
  - The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
  - School performance based on the budget per student
  - School performance based on the school size 
  - School performance based on the type of school
